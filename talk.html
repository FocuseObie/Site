    <p>Machine Learning in Artificial Intelligence</p>
    <p>Another important thing about me is that I not only love to learn and improve, but I also love to talk about topics and help those around me learn (if they are interested). So, if you see an intersection of interests, feel free to reach out. I may not be currently invested in the topic, but I might be of use, or maybe youâ€™ll rekindle my interest in the topic, or maybe we can just have a conversation about whatever it is you want to talk about, just reach out.</p>
