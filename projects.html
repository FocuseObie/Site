            <h4>Building/Fixing Stuff</h4>
            <p>Been building and repairing electronics on a component level for a while.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Built a generic desktop from components for personal use</li>
              <li>Replaced personal desktop by building a new one</li>
              <li>Repaired two non-functioning crypto miners (5950x's setup mining Monero XMrig p2pool)</li>
              <li>Built a home server replacing personal desktop</li>
              <li>Built a Network Attached Server for file storage (ubuntu server technically) which interfaces with the main server</li>
              <li>Built a simple IP camera. Used a Raspberry-Pi and camera module, built with <a href="https://github.com/motioneye-project/motioneyeos/wiki">MotionEye operating system</a>. Also did some soldering to get the cable set up.</li>
              <li>Flashed custom (<a href="https://www.coreboot.org/users.html">coreboot</a>) bios/uefi to my laptop, involved dissasembly and using a CH431a programmer to flash it to a chip on the motherboard  </li>
            </ul> 
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h4>Misc Code Stuff</h4>
            <p>Also been coding for a while, but usually only quick task automation and stuff I genuinely feel useful, so here are some more serious projects (as well as languages I've used).</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Developed an app from front end to back end using Dart and Flutter for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quicksports-sports-near-you/id1629551608">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flutterflow.courts&hl=en">Android</a> (the app is functional but is not being updated to my knowledge). Also scraped a dataset of sporting locations and implemented it (along with basic app data) in FireBase. Worked with Google Analytics and getting  code approved for Google AdSense.</li>
              <li>I built some decent code to "scrape" (api hack?) data from some my school's outcomes pages for research with the department of Economics</li>
              <li>Set up a server i.e. just Linux terminal which took about as much learning and effort as any other big project</li>
              <li>I built a program to cheat in scrabble, user inputs the alloted number of letters, code returns and sorts the top possible official scrabble words by points. Sadly this was made before Wordle, and before I had any good practices for storing my code so it is lost, but it was in javascript for some reason anyways. It had a very nice UI and I learned a lot about managing decent size datasets and code optimization, but again, in javascript...</li>
              <li>Built an actual webscraper for an unnamed popular online auction site, which was matched with code to calculate crypto mining hash rate and USD conversion, it scrapes listings for computers and computer parts, the code searches listings details against a dataset of "mining parts" then takes the live hash rate and live USD conversion for the most profitable coin at the moment (and given hardware, CPU/GPU architecture).</li>
              <li>I've written projects in (most to least): Python, Javascript, Java, Dart/Flutter, C++, and this website in HTML (no CSS if you couldn't tell lol). Plus Linux I guess? I use it on my daily and server if it counts.</li>
            </ul> 
        </li>
