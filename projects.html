            <h4>Building/Fixing Stuff</h4>
            <p>Been building and repairing electronics on a component level for a while.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Built a generic desktop from components for personal use</li>
              <li>Replaced personal desktop by building a new one</li>
              <li>Repaired two non-functioning crypto miners (5950x's setup mining Monero XMrig p2pool)</li>
              <li>Built a home server replacing personal desktop</li>
              <li>Built a Network Attached Server for file storage (ubuntu server technically) which interfaces with the main server</li>
              <li>Built a simple IP camera. Used a Raspberry-Pi and camera module, built with <a href="https://github.com/motioneye-project/motioneyeos/wiki">MotionEye operating system</a>. Also did some soldering to get the cable set up.</li>
              <li>Flashed custom (<a href="https://www.coreboot.org/users.html">coreboot</a>) bios/uefi to my laptop, involved dissasembly and using a CH431a programmer to flash it to a chip on the motherboard  </li>
            </ul> 
        </li>

            <h4>Misc Code Stuff</h4>
            <p>Also been coding for a while, but usually only quick task automation and stuff I genuinely feel useful, so here are some more serious projects (as well as languages I've used.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Developed an app from front end to back end using Dart and Flutter. Also scraped a dataset of sporting locations and implemented it (along with basic app data) in FireBase. Also go experience with Google Analytics and getting  code approved for Google AdSense.</li>
              <li>I built some decent code to "scrape" (api hack?) data from some my school's outcomes pages for research with the department of Economics</li>
              <li>Set up a server i.e. just Linux terminal which took about as much learning and effort as any other big project</li>
              <li>I built a program to cheat in scrabble, user inputs the alloted number of letters, code returns and sorts the top possible official scrabble words by points. Sadly this was made before Wordle, and before I had good practiced of storing my code so it is lost, but it was in javascript for some reason anyways. Had a very nice UI and learned a lot about managing decent size datasets and code optimization, but again sadly in javascript...</li>
              <li>I've written projects in (most to least): Python, Javascript, Java, Dart/Flutter, C++, and this website in HTML (no CSS if you couldn't tell lol). Plus Linux I guess? I use it on my daily and server if it counts.</li>
              <li>Repaired two non-functioning crypto miners (5950x's I got setup mining Monero p2p on XMrig atm)</li>
              <li>Built a home server replacing personal desktop</li>
              <li>Built a Network Attached Server for file storage (ubuntu server technically) which interfaces with the main server</li>
              <li>Built a simple IP camera. Used a Raspberry-Pi and camera module, built with <a href="https://github.com/motioneye-project/motioneyeos/wiki">MotionEye operating system</a>. Also did some soldering to get the cable set up.</li>
              <li>Flashed custom (<a href="https://www.coreboot.org/users.html">coreboot</a>) bios/uefi to my laptop, involved dissasembly and using a CH431a programmer to flash it to a chip on the motherboard  </li>
