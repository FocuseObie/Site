    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, and as I'm sure you know my name is Kaden Oberlander. If I were to define my ethos, it would simply be that I am an individual whose base desire is to learn and improve, and I enjoy applying my knowledge to solve problems and better understand my surroundings. As such I am currently at college majoring in fields which I feel will give me the appropriate tools, namely Mathematics, Statistics, and Economics, to solve the problems I find most interesting. This interest in learning manifests itself in my proclivity to pick up (often unrelated) <a href="talk.html">interests</a> and devote too much time to them, which you can now read about on this site.</p>
    <p>Another important thing about me is that I not only love to learn and improve, but I also love to talk about these topics and help those around me learn (if they are interested). So, if you see an intersection of interests, feel free to reach out. While I may not be currently invested in the topic, I might be of use, or maybe youâ€™ll rekindle my interest in the topic, or maybe we can just have a conversation about whatever it is you want to talk about, just reach out.</p>
