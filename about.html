    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, and as I'm sure you know, my name is Kaden Oberlander. If I were to define my ethos, it would simply be that I am an individual whose base desire is to learn and improve, and I enjoy applying my knowledge to solve problems and better understand my surroundings. As such I am currently at IU Bloomington learning as much as I can in fields which I feel will give me the appropriate tools; namely Mathematics, Statistics, and Economics, to solve the problems I find most interesting. Right now those problems are probably from Abstract Algebra and Representation Theory.</p>
    <p>Another important thing about me is that I not only love to learn and improve, but I also love to talk about these topics with those around me (if they are interested). So, if you see an intersection of interests, feel free to reach out. While I may not be currently invested in the topic, I might be of use, or maybe you’ll rekindle my interest in the topic, or maybe we can just have a conversation about whatever it is you want to talk about. I am always looking for new problems to solve and new perspectives to consider.</p>
