    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, and as I'm sure you know, my name is Kaden Oberlander. If I were to define my ethos, it would simply be that I am an individual whose base desire is to learn and improve, and I enjoy applying my knowledge to solve problems and better understand my surroundings. As such I am currently at college learning as much as I can in fields which I feel will give me the appropriate tools, namely Mathematics, Statistics, and Economics, to solve the problems I find most interesting. This interest in learning manifests itself in my proclivity to pick up (often unrelated) interests and devote too much time to them, which you can now read about on this site.</p>
    <p>Another important thing about me is that I not only love to learn and improve, but I also love to talk about these topics and help those around me learn (if they are interested). So, if you see an intersection of interests, feel free to reach out. While I may not be currently invested in the topic, I might be of use, or maybe you’ll rekindle my interest in the topic, or maybe we can just have a conversation about whatever it is you want to talk about, just reach out.</p>

    <h1>Some Current Interests (last updated Sept. 01 2025)</h1>
    <p>Frankly, what will be captivating me most for the near future are my courses. The stars aligned and I managed to get a beautiful schedule: Hon. Analysis, Hon. Probabiity Theory, Hon. Modern Alg., Logic, and Partial Differential Equations.</p>
    <p>When I am not doing problem sets or reading, I will probably be:</p> 
    <li>Fueling my growing Riichi Mahjong addiction, either WWYD 4, Riichi Mahjong Strategy Guide, or trying to get out of Adept on MS</li>
    <li>Slamming pickleballs (Team name: The Lob-otomizers)</li>   
    <li>Troubleshooting whatever I break next in OpenBSD and learning more about Unix</li>
    <li>Classical Guitar (not adding any new pieces, just maintenance when I have the time)</li>
    <li>Learning/practicing Russian ~ A2/B1 on CEFR scale</li>
